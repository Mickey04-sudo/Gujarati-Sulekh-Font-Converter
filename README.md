# Sulekh Gujarati Font Converter

The Sulekh Gujarati Font Converter is a Python-based tool developed to convert Gujarati text from the legacy Sulekh font encoding to modern Unicode-compliant Gujarati text. This project addresses a major challenge faced by archivists, publishers, and institutions working with historic documents typed in non-Unicode fonts.

Due to the lack of Unicode support in older fonts like Sulekh, such documents are often incompatible with web browsers, mobile devices, and modern software. This converter bridges the gap by intelligently mapping encoded Sulekh glyphs to their corresponding Unicode representations — ensuring accurate, script-aware output.
